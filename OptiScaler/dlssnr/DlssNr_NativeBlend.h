// "Native blend" on the Neural Rendering page: run NR on the finished picture and write the model's answer as it is,
// leaving all blending to NR's own Intensity. It sets four settings and remembers what they were, so turning it off puts
// every one back (an unset one stays unset). Plain data and rules, no config and no ImGui, so
// tests/nr_native_blend_smoke.cpp runs them; dlssnr/DlssNr_Menu.cpp draws the control and Config.cpp keeps the
// remembered values in [DlssNr] (NativeBlend and NativeBlendWas*).
//
// What the settings do on a tone-mapped (SDR) frame, where nothing else of ours touches the picture:
//   FinishedPicture      NR runs on the finished picture
//   ReversibleMode 2     Replace: the model's answer is the picture, with no composition and no highlight guard
//   SkinProtection off   no skin / environment attenuation of the final edit
//   ReplaceDetailStrength 0   no native detail put back below 100% model resolution
// On an HDR frame the answer still goes through a curve, so the menu says it is not a true native match.
